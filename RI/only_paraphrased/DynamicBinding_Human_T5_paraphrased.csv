Calling a function or assigning a value to a variable at run time means Dynamic Binding. Dynamic binding can be linked with runtime polymorphism and inheritance in OOPs. As a program
At run time you call the functions or assign the values to a variable and hence it calls the Dynamic Binding (Dymamic Binding). The Dynamic Binding process is associated with run time polymorph
