Demand paging is a method of virtual memory management which is based on the principle that pages should only be brought into memory 
if the executing process demands them. This is often referred to as lazy evaluation as only those pages demanded by the process are 
swapped from secondary storage to main memory.
So demand paging works opposite to the principle of loading all pages immediately.

Demand paging is a memory management technique used by operating systems to improve memory utilization and performance. 
In demand paging, only the required pages of a process are loaded into the main memory, rather than loading the entire process into
 memory at once. Pages are loaded into memory on demand, as they are needed by the process during execution.

This technique allows for more efficient use of memory resources, as only the necessary pages are loaded into memory at any given time.
 It also reduces the amount of time required for program loading and startup, as only a subset of the programs pages need to be loaded
 into memory initially.
