A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve
 large amounts of data efficiently and effectively. A database is used to store data in a structured and organized way so that it can
 be easily accessed, queried, and analyzed.

A database is typically made up of one or more tables, each of which contains data about a specific type of object or entity. 
Each table consists of a set of columns that define the attributes of the data being stored, and a set of rows that contain the 
actual data.
