Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that
 enable computers to improve their performance in tasks through experience. These algorithms and models are designed to learn from data 
and make predictions or decisions without explicit instructions. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised 
learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while 
unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning involves training a model through trial and 
error. Machine learning is used in a wide variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, 
and recommender systems.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can 
automatically learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms to recognize 
patterns in data, make predictions or decisions, and perform tasks based on that data.

Machine learning is based on the idea that computers can learn from data, and that they can improve their performance over time through 
exposure to more data.
