A stop word is a commonly used word that a search engine has been programmed to ignore,
 both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query. 
We would not want these words to take up space in our database, or taking up valuable processing time. For this,
 we can remove them easily, by storing a list of words that you consider to stop words.

Stop words are common words that are frequently used in natural language but do not carry much meaning or importance in a given text.
Stop words are often removed from text before analysis because they do not contribute much to the meaning of a sentence or document, 
and can even interfere with certain types of analysis such as sentiment analysis. By removing stop words, the analysis can focus on the 
more important words that convey the main ideas and themes of the text.
