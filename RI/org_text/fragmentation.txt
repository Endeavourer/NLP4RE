An unwanted problem in the operating system in which the processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, and free memory space is fragmented.
 Processes canâ€™t be assigned to memory blocks due to their small size, and the memory blocks stay unused. 
It is also necessary to understand that as programs are loaded and deleted from memory, they generate free space or a hole in the memory. 
These small blocks cannot be allotted to new arriving processes, resulting in inefficient memory use.

The conditions of fragmentation depend on the memory allocation system. As the process is loaded and unloaded from memory, 
these areas are fragmented into small pieces of memory that cannot be allocated to incoming processes. It is called fragmentation.

Fragmentation is a common problem in computer systems that occurs when files or data are stored on a hard drive or other storage device
 in a non-contiguous manner, meaning that they are split up into multiple fragments or pieces that are scattered throughout the drive. 
This can occur due to various reasons, such as file deletions, file additions, and file modifications over time.

Fragmentation can lead to several performance issues, including slower file access times, slower boot times, and longer backup and 
restore times. This is because the computers file system needs to search for and access each fragment of the file separately, 
which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
