Data Abstraction is a process of hiding unwanted or irrelevant details from the end user. It provides a different view and helps in 
achieving data independence which is used to enhance the security of data.

Database systems include complex data structures. In terms of retrieval of data, reduce complexity in terms of usability of users and 
in order to make the system efficient, developers use levels of abstraction that hide irrelevant details from the users. Levels of 
abstraction simplify database design.

Data abstraction in DBMS refers to the process of hiding the complex details of a database from the users and applications that 
interact with it. It allows users to interact with a database at a higher level of abstraction, without needing to know the underlying 
details of how the data is stored and managed.

Data abstraction is achieved through the use of various database models, such as the relational model, object-oriented model, and 
hierarchical model. Each of these models provides a different level of abstraction, with the relational model being the most commonly 
used model in modern DBMS.
