Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. 
Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meanings to one word. 
Text preprocessing includes both Stemming as well as Lemmatization. Many times people find these two terms confusing. Some treat 
these two as the same. Actually, lemmatization is preferred over Stemming because lemmatization does morphological analysis of the words.

Lemmatization is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves reducing a word to its base or root form, known as the 
lemma. The lemma is the canonical or dictionary form of a word, which captures the underlying meaning and is typically a noun, verb, 
adjective or adverb.

Lemmatization is important in NLP because it helps to reduce the number of unique words in a text, which can improve the accuracy of 
certain types of analysis, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and machine translation. By reducing words to their base form, 
lemmatization also helps to overcome the challenge of morphological variations in language, such as verb tense, plurals, and comparative 
or superlative forms of adjectives.
