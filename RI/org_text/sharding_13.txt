Sharding is a method of splitting and storing a single logical dataset in multiple databases. 
By distributing the data among multiple machines, a cluster of database systems can store larger dataset and handle 
additional requests. Sharding is necessary if a dataset is too large to be stored in a single database. Moreover, many 
sharding strategies allow additional machines to be added. Sharding allows a database cluster to scale along with its data and 
traffic growth.

Sharding is a database architecture technique in which a large database is divided into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards.
 Each shard contains a subset of the overall data and is stored on a separate server or cluster of servers. The goal of sharding is to
 improve the performance and scalability of a database by distributing the load across multiple servers.
