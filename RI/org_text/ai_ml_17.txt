Human:

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are two closely related but distinct fields within the broader field of computer science.
 AI is a discipline that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such 
as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing. It involves the development of algorithms 
and systems that can reason, learn, and make decisions based on input data.

On the other hand, Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that involves teaching machines to learn from data without being explicitly 
programmed. ML algorithms can identify patterns and trends in data and use them to make predictions and decisions. ML is used to build 
predictive models, classify data, and recognize patterns, and is an essential tool for many AI applications.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are related but distinct fields in computer science. AI is a broader term that refers 
to the development of intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, 
reasoning, learning, and decision-making. ML is a specific subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models 
that can automatically learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed.
ML, on the other hand, is focused on the development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time.
