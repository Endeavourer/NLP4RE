In Round robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. 
This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes. Widely used preemptive scheduling method in traditional OS. 
All the jobs get a fair allocation of CPU. Cons include : Finding a correct time quantum is a quite difficult task in this system, 
Round robin scheduling doesnâ€™t give special priority to more important tasks.

Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm that is commonly used in operating systems. It is a preemptive algorithm that assigns a fixed 
time slice, called a time quantum, to each process in a circular order. When a process is scheduled, it is allowed to run for a fixed 
amount of time, and then it is preempted and the next process in the queue is allowed to run for its own time quantum.

The key advantage of the Round Robin algorithm is that it ensures fairness by allocating equal time slices to each process in the system, 
regardless of the process priority or other characteristics. This helps to prevent any single process from monopolizing the CPU and 
ensures that each process gets a fair share of processing time.
