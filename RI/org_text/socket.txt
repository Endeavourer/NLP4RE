A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication, A pair of processes communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets, 
one for each process. A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number.
The server waits for incoming client requests by listening to a specified port. Once a request is received, the server accepts a
 connection from the client socket to complete the connection.

A socket is a communication endpoint that is used to establish a connection between two different processes over a network. 
In computer networking, a socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number that uniquely identifies a specific process on a 
particular device. Sockets are commonly used in client-server architectures to allow applications to communicate with one another 
over the internet or a local network.
