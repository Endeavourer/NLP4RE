ANN learning is robust to errors in the training data and has been successfully applied for learning real-valued, discrete-valued, 
and vector-valued functions containing problems such as interpreting visual scenes, speech recognition, and learning robot control 
strategies. The study of artificial neural networks has been inspired in part by the observation that biological learning 
systems are built of very complex webs of interconnected neurons in brains.
Generally, ANNs are built out of a densely interconnected set of simple units, where each unit takes a number of real-valued inputs 
and produces a single real-valued output. But ANNs are less motivated by biological neural systems, there are many complexities to 
biological neural systems that are not modeled by ANNs.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. 
ANNs consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that are organized in layers and can learn to recognize patterns in data through a 
process of training.

ANNs are typically composed of three types of layers: input, hidden, and output layers. The input layer receives the input data, which 
is then processed by the hidden layers, and the output layer produces the final output.

Each neuron in an ANN receives input from the neurons in the previous layer, and applies a mathematical function to the input to produce 
an output, which is then passed to the next layer. The connections between the neurons in an ANN have weights that can be adjusted 
during training to improve the accuracy of the model.
