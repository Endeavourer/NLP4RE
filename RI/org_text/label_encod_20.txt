In machine learning, we usually deal with datasets that contain multiple labels in one or more than one columns. These labels 
can be in the form of words or numbers. To make the data understandable or in human-readable form, the training data is often 
labelled in words. 

Label Encoding refers to converting the labels into a numeric form so as to convert them into the machine readable form. Machine 
learning algorithms can then decide in a better way how those labels must be operated. It is an important pre-processing step for 
the structured dataset in supervised learning.

Label encoding is a process of converting categorical data into numerical data in machine learning. In label encoding, each category 
in a categorical variable is assigned a unique numerical value or label. This allows machine learning algorithms to process and analyze 
categorical data as numerical data.
Label encoding is commonly used when the categorical data is ordinal, meaning there is an inherent order to the categories.
