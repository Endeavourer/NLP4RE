A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer processes waits for a resource which is being assigned to some other process. 
In this situation, none of the processes gets executed since the resource it needs is held by some other process which is also waiting 
for some other resource to be released.  Deadlock happens when Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, No preemption and circular wait occurs simultaneously.

A deadlock is a situation that can occur in computer systems, particularly in multi-tasking environments, where two or more processes or threads are unable to continue executing because they are waiting for each other to release resources they are holding.
This can occur due to a lack of synchronization between the processes, incorrect resource allocation, or other issues related to the management of shared resources.

Deadlocks can be problematic for computer systems because they can cause the system to become unresponsive or crash.
