When a compiler acknowledges all the information required to call a function or all the values of the variables during compile time, 
it is called static binding. As all the required information is known before runtime, it increases the program efficiency and it also 
enhances the speed of execution of a program. Static Binding makes a program very efficient, but it declines the program flexibility, as values of variable and function calling are 
predefined in the program. Static binding is implemented in a program at the time of coding. Overloading a function or an operator is 
the example of compile time polymorphism i.e. static binding.

Static binding is a mechanism used in computer programming languages to resolve references to variables, functions, and other symbols at compile-time.

In static binding, the compiler maps a reference to a specific memory location before the program is run. This means that the reference is bound to a specific value or address at compile-time and remains fixed throughout the program's execution. This is in contrast to dynamic binding, where the mapping is done at runtime.

Static binding is often used in low-level languages and provides faster performance than dynamic binding. However, it can also be less flexible, as changes to the program require recompilation to update the references.
