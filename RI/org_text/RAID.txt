RAID or Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a 
single disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both. Data redundancy, although taking up extra space, adds to disk reliability.
This means, in case of disk failure, if the same data is also backed up onto another disk, we can retrieve the data and go on with the 
operation.

RAID, which stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is a storage technology that involves combining multiple hard drives into a single logical unit to provide improved performance, data redundancy, or both. RAID can be implemented either through software or hardware, and it comes in different levels or configurations.
