It is a banker algorithm used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process in the computer system. 
The S State examines all possible tests or activities before deciding whether the allocation should be allowed to each process. 
It also helps the operating system to successfully share the resources between all the processes. The bankers algorithm is named 
because it checks whether a person should be sanctioned a loan amount or not to help the bank system safely simulate allocation resources.

The Bankers algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems to prevent the occurrence of deadlocks in a multi-process environment. 
It was developed by Edsger Dijkstra and named after the concept of bankers who loan money based on the available cash.

The Bankers algorithm works by simulating the allocation of resources to processes, and then checking if the allocation could potentially lead to a deadlock. 
It works by keeping track of the available resources, the maximum resources that can be requested by each process, and the resources that are currently allocated to each process.
