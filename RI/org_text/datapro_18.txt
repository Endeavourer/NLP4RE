Data Processing is the task of converting data from a given form to a much more usable and desired form making it more meaningful 
and informative. Using Machine Learning algorithms, mathematical modeling, and statistical knowledge, this entire process can be automated.
 The output of this complete process can be in any desired form like graphs, videos, charts, tables, images, and many more, depending on 
the task we are performing and the requirements of the machine. 
Data processing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, as it prepares the data for use in building and training ML models. 
The goal of data processing is to clean, transform, and prepare the data in a format that is suitable for modeling.

Data processing in machine learning refers to the steps involved in preparing and transforming raw data into a format that can be 
used to train machine learning algorithms. This includes tasks such as data cleaning, feature extraction, normalization, and 
transformation.
The goal of data processing in machine learning is to ensure that the data is of high quality, relevant, and in a suitable format for 
training the machine learning model. This is important as the quality of the data can greatly affect the performance of the model. 
Effective data processing is essential for successful machine learning applications.
