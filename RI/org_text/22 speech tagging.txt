The part of speech explains how a word is used in a sentence. In a sentence, a word can have different contexts and semantic meanings. 
The basic natural language processing models like bag-of-words fail to identify these relations between words. Hence, we use part of 
speech tagging to mark a word to its part of speech tag based on its context in the data. It is also used to extract relationships 
between words.

Speech tagging, also known as part-of-speech tagging, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to assign grammatical tags or
 labels to individual words in a sentence. The tags indicate the syntactic category of the word, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb,
 pronoun, preposition, conjunction, or interjection.

Speech tagging is an important step in many NLP applications, such as text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition, and machine 
translation. It helps to disambiguate the meaning of words in a sentence by providing context for their use.
