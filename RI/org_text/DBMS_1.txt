Database Management System is a software for storing and retrieving users data while considering appropriate security measures.
 It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs
 the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and 
retrieve data.

A Database Management System is a software system that allows users to store, organize, manage, and retrieve data from a database. 
The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and manage data in a secure and efficient manner.

A DBMS consists of several components, including the database, the database engine, the data definition language, the data manipulation
 language, and the query language. The database is a collection of related data that is organized in a particular way, while the 
database engine is responsible for managing the data stored in the database.
