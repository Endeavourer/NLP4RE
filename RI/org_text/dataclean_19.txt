Data cleaning is one of the important parts of machine learning. It plays a significant part in building a model. 
It surely isn’t the fanciest part of machine learning and at the same time, there aren’t any hidden tricks or secrets to uncover. 
However, the success or failure of a project relies on proper data cleaning.
If we have a well cleaned dataset, there are chances that we can get achieve good results with simple algorithms also, 
which can prove very beneficial at times especially in terms of computation when the dataset size is large.

Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing 
values in a dataset. Data cleaning is an important step in preparing data for analysis or machine learning, as it helps to ensure 
that the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.
The goal of data cleaning is to improve the quality of the data and ensure that it is suitable for analysis or machine learning. 
Effective data cleaning can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the data.
